### Description
This project was an extremely useful one; it showed me that simple webpages (or markdown files) can be dynamically generated using JavaScript (Node.js). I've generated all of the README files for my projects using this application. 

### Installation
This program requires Node and the Inquirer package to run in the command line. 

### Usage
After installing Node.js on your computer, you'll then need to install the inquirer package by typing the following into your CLI: "npm install inquirer". 
Now you're ready to run the program; simply type "node genrtrApp.js" into your CLI and the program will appear.
